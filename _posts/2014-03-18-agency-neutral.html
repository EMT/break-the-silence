<p>
	Welcome to Agency Neutral, a creative co-operative of adland's finest, whose time has been kindly donated by their brands and agencies to help save humanity.
</p>

<p>
	We focus on finding solutions first and then source likeminded clients to be part of the project. We create disruptive campaigns designed to galvanise the creative industry to start tackling climate change, motivate the rest of the world to do their bit and collaborate with brands to help them get greener. 
</p>

<p>
	And no thinking is wasted, with any ideas that don't get used going into a bank that all contributing companies can access. Because, let's face it, some ideas are too good to keep to ourselves.
