	97% of the world’s climate scientists tell us that climate change is accelerating fast and the primary cause is the human driven release of carbon emissions through the burning of fossil fuels. To mitigate and avoid catastrophic climate change we must radically reduce our high carbon ways of living. So carbon literacy and transparency feel central to that shift.

    In the competitive spirit of the agency world around billings, awards, effectiveness etc, how about a carbon billings league? In this Top 10 list we’ll have ranked each agency by the collective carbon footprint of their client list and the agency with the highest carbon footprint comes top.  Got and oil and gas client?  Or a car manufacturer?  Or an airline?  You’re doing well. But with Carbon Billings being top may not be for the best.
